Fabulous
========

Fabulous is a simple set of Fabric tasks for use in small Django and Flask projects.

It provides the user with a convention-based API for common local and remote task execution.

It is not designed for large deployments - the Fabulous sweet spot is for projects with one remote host, where a larger remote execution framework like Salt might be an overkill.
